League of Legends (LoL) is an immensely popular multiplayer online battle arena game, with over 100 million monthly active users worldwide. It hosts progressional competitions throughout the year and had 43 million viewers in the 2016 World Championships alone. For context, that's more than the 30.8 million viewers that watched Game 7 of the 2016 NBA finals! Published by Riot Games, LOL is clearly fun and addictive once you get started. For those who haven't, here's a quick overview of the game itself.

10 players are divided into 2 teams (blue or red) in the main LoL game (there are 3 modes). The objective for each team is to destroy the opposing teams "Nexus". Think of the Nexus as the main building in a base camp. Destroy the enemy Nexus and your team wins the game. Protect yours or your team loses the game. Simple enough. However, the collaboration often required between teammates to advance on the enemy Nexus, while defending its own, is wonderfully complex.

Let's dive right in.
